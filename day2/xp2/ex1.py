# Define what are the categorical features and what are the continuous features. Be sure to
# define ordinal vs nominal.

# Categorical features are variables that take on a limited number of possible values. These values can be either nominal or ordinal. Nominal categorical variables do not have any inherent order or ranking, and the values are typically represented as labels or categories. Examples of nominal categorical variables include the color of a car or the breed of a dog. Ordinal categorical variables, on the other hand, have a natural order or ranking among the values. Examples of ordinal categorical variables include the size of a t-shirt (e.g., small, medium, large) or the level of education (e.g., high school, college, graduate degree).
# Continuous features, also known as numerical features, are variables that can take on any value within a range or interval. They can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete numerical variables can only take on integer values, while continuous numerical variables can take on any value within a range. Examples of continuous numerical variables include age, height, and weight.
